\begin{abstract}
How users will interact with data in the future is always unclear.  Currently we see Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab emerging in many places as the way forward for one aspect of this.  In LSST we identify two other aspects common to many data providers: the portal aspect and the API/Data Services Aspect.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

It seems timely to consider how we might offer users a smoother experience as they move between data providers.
Current VO services allow one to send queries to multiple centres but in the notebook environment one may wish to do something more sophisticated. We should consider whether users can send requests from one centre to another or whether the same notebooks should be runnable in different centres.
How do we deal with batch processing - large jobs? How do we manage resources/quotas (disk/memory/cpu)?  How can we enable users to share their work (both notebooks and data) and create ad-hoc scientific collaborations?
We would have a few short presentations on these topics and discuss the future and perhaps give direction to IVOA in this emerging area.

Draft Agenda\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Intro set scene (William O'Mullane/Michael Wise)
\item Strict 5 minute position talks:(30 minutes)
\item LSST Approach (Gregory Dubois-Felsmann or Oâ€™Mullane)
\item SciServer Approach (Lemson or Won Kim or Popp)
\item European Space Science Data Centre (Merin)
\item NOAO approach (...)
\item Others ..
\item Discussion on areas to work together on and potential input to IVOA (20-30min).
\end{itemize}
